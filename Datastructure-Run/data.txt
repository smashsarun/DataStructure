If you became concerned about a mole on your back — perhaps it had become painful
 or looked unsightly — your doctor might decide to remove it and have it evaluated.
 She’d send it to a pathology lab, where a sample of the tissue would be prepared
 in the form of a slide. It would then be sent to a pathologist,
 who would examine the slide to determine whether the tissue had 
any problematic elements, like cancer. After taking a look, 
the pathologist might ship it to a specialist at another lab for
 a second opinion. Each time the slide is moved, it is packed up and
 shipped to a different address. All the while, you’re waiting days
 or even weeks to hear whether or not you have cancer.
